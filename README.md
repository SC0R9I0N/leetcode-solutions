# leetcode-solutions

This repository is a collection of my personal LeetCode solutions to various problems in various languages. Solutions may be updated to fit a better design upon later reflection.
- Started working on some files for this repo, but I'm not sure how to go about organizing this in its entirety. I would like to include solutions to problems in multiple languages, but I think I will just simply have to add each file individually as I work through them rather than push from a different JetBrains IDE each time I do a solution.
- Due to the nature of this repository, I don't think I will be able to use git as much as I would like, so files will most likely be added manually.
